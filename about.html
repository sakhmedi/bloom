            <h3>What We Are</h3>
            <p>Bloom is an open library dedicated to the art of seeing flowers — truly seeing them. We catalog species not to classify, but to celebrate: the architecture of a petal, the quiet drama of a stem in light, the geometry that most people walk past without a second glance.</p>

            <h3>Our Mission</h3>
            <p>The world already knows the rose. We're here for the ones it overlooks. Our mission is to surface the extraordinary beauty that lives in every flowering species — not just the familiar favorites, but the unusual, the understated, and the wildly strange. We believe every bloom deserves its moment, viewed from an angle no one thought to try.</p>

            <h3>A Different Perspective</h3>
            <p>Flowers have been photographed, painted, and poeticized for centuries, yet most of us still see them through the same narrow lens. Bloom exists to challenge that. We look closer, from unexpected vantage points, and invite you to reconsider what you thought you already knew about the botanical world.</p>
